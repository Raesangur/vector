# vector
My own vector implementation in C++, using features of C++20, and a lot of different toolings.
This is mostly a project I made to try out new features and tooling such as static analyzers, sanitizers, documentation generators and various compilers.


Tools used:  
On Ubuntu 20.04 (running on WSL)

- `g++` 10.1
- `clang++` 10.0
- `clang-tidy` 10.0
- `clang-format` 10.0
- `cmake` 3.17.1
- `doxygen` 1.8.16

Plus `msbuild` 16.5 with Visual Studio 2019 on Windows 10
